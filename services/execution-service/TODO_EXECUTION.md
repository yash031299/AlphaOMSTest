# üõ†Ô∏è Execution Service ‚Äì TODO & Backlog Tracker

This file documents all remaining tasks to make the execution-service fully production-ready, secure, and observable. You can track them phase-wise as you complete the rest of the system.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Modular executors: LimitOrderExecutor, MarketOrderExecutor, SLOrderExecutor
- [x] gRPC server implemented
- [x] Logging for all execution types
- [x] Stateless execution for horizontal scalability
- [x] Unit-tested using gRPC Python client

## üü° Phase 1 ‚Äî To Do During Order-Router Integration

| Task                                       | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [ ] Fill event broadcasting                | Publish execution fills to Redis/Kafka for downstream RMS/wallet update |
| [ ] Execution audit persistence            | Save fill data to Redis or DB for reconciliation                        |
| [ ] Fee & slippage logic                   | Add configurable fee, slippage logic inside `execute()` functions       |
| [ ] Trade ID or Order ID handling          | Accept and echo trade/order IDs from upstream                           |
| [ ] Trigger downstream RMS or Wallet hooks | Notify RMS/wallet for margin sync after execution                       |

## üîµ Phase 2 ‚Äî Pre-Production Hardening

| Task                                      | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| [ ] Enable TLS/mTLS for gRPC              | Secure inter-service communication                   |
| [ ] Add gRPC healthcheck endpoint         | For Kubernetes liveness/readiness probe              |
| [ ] Add Prometheus metrics                | Track orders/sec, execution latency, failures        |
| [ ] Add retry mechanism & circuit breaker | Prevent crash loops under load or downstream failure |

## üî¥ Optional Phase 3 ‚Äî Advanced Optimizations

| Task                            | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [ ] Slippage simulation         | Simulate order book matching, worst price fills |
| [ ] Fee engine abstraction      | Separate dynamic fee logic per user/pair        |
| [ ] Execution latency profiling | Track time from gRPC call to actual execution   |
| [ ] Smart order routing logic   | Add support for external hedge or split routing |

## Notes

- All current executor logic is clean, stateless, testable, and ready for production integration.
- Missing pieces will be added once `order-router`, `wallet`, and `RMS` are fully integrated.
- Execution logic should **not handle PnL or margin** ‚Äî those live in `risk-service`.
